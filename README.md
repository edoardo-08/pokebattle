# pokebattle
This is a simple project i made for practice with python and databases.

The program consist of a graphical user interface, made with tkinter, that let you select two pokemons from a database of all existing and make them fight, declaring a winner.

Instruction:
1. After downloading and extracting the files in the download folder, run pokebattle. A graphical window should open.
2. Click on search pokemon, choose two pokemon by entering their full name and clicking on select fighter. Click start battle.

For the pokedex database i used the file found on Kaggle.com https://www.kaggle.com/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420
which i transformed in a sqlite database with the program create_pokedex (that you don't need to run).
